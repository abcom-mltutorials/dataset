"Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order. The United Nations has announced that it is immediately allocating $20 million to scale up UN humanitarian operations in Ukraine following Russia's invasion. In an apparent message to countries which are not standing by its side or are supporting Moscow, US President Joe Biden has said that any nation that countenances Russia's naked aggression and a ""totally unjustifiable"" war against Ukraine will be stained by association. US and European officials are holding one key financial sanction against Russia in reserve, choosing not to boot Russia off SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions."
